# Welcome to Uvicore

The Fullstack Asynchronous API+Web+CLI Python Framework

```
Uvicore
    = Dual Routers based on Starlette and FastAPI
    + Automatic Model router for instant OpenAPI endpoints
    + Beautiful Custom ORM with built in Pydantic Validations and column mapping
    + Async everything, including CLI commands that can await your async methods
    + Instant app scaffolding to get started building modules and apps instantly
    + File generators to scaffold controllers, commands, models, tables and other code
```


## Why Uvicore?

Fullstack, Modular and Asynchronous. A Full Solution for Web, API and CLI Development.

Micro frameworks are great!  They become the building blocks for larger structures and fullstack frameworks.  Starlette and FastAPI for example are fantastic building blocks.  But most projects require structure, standards and many libraries and layers that work together.

Uvicore is the missing fullstack asynchronous framework for elegant and rapid python development.

## Uvicore vs Microframework

Uvicore is built on many libraries and modules including FastAPI, Starlette, Pydantic and SQLAlchemy.  But it combines all of those and more into a beautiful full stack framework out of the box.

**Uvicore adds**

- Structure and folder standardizations for large projects
- Scaffolding to generate entire projects or individual files
- Modularization.  Every app is a module and every module is an app
- Deep nested config management across modules
- IoC container for Inversion of Control to swap any implementation
- Custom ORM on top of SQLAlchemy Core and Pydantic
- ORM Models are deeply integrated into OpenAPI and can auto generate full nested endpoints.
- Authentication middleware for easy JWT API integration with your IDP








## Inspiration

- Heavily inspired by the amazing PHP Laravel Framework.
- Inspired by Django, Django Rest Framework, Starlette and FastAPI.
- Uvicore utilizes Starlette as the "web" router.
- Uvicore utilizes FastAPI as the "api" router and OpenAPI document generation.
- Uvicore utilizes smurfix/asyncclick for full async CLIs that can await your existing async methods.
- Uvicore utilizes SQLAlchemy "core" and encode/databases, but adds its own custom ORM for elegant queries and models.
