## :material-pound: Why Uvicore?

Fullstack, Modular and Asynchronous. A Full Solution for Web, API and CLI Development!

Micro frameworks are great!  They become the building blocks for larger structures and fullstack
frameworks.  Starlette and FastAPI for example are fantastic building blocks.  But most projects
require structure, standards and many libraries and layers that work together.

---




## :material-pound: Full Stack vs Micro Frameworks

Uvicore is built on many libraries and modules including FastAPI, Starlette, Pydantic and SQLAlchemy.

**Uvicore Streamlines the Developer Experience by providing:**

- **Structure** and folder standardizations for large projects.
- **Scaffolding** to generate entire projects and individual classes and methods.
- **Modularization** with no "shell".  Every app is a module and every module is an app.
- **Config First** drive modules with deep nesting and override power.
- **IoC container** for Inversion of Control to swap any implementation.
- **Custom ORM** on top of SQLAlchemy Core and Pydantic.
- **Automatic Model Router** drives deep nested API endpoints instantly from your relational models.
- **Authentication middleware** for easy token based API authentication with any standards IDP.

## :material-pound: Inspiration

- Heavily inspired by the amazing PHP Laravel Framework.
- Inspired by Django, Django Rest Framework, Starlette and FastAPI.
- Uvicore utilizes Starlette as the "web" router.
- Uvicore utilizes FastAPI as the "api" router and OpenAPI document generation.
- Uvicore utilizes smurfix/asyncclick for full async CLIs that can await your existing async methods.
- Uvicore utilizes SQLAlchemy "core" and encode/databases, but adds its own custom ORM for elegant queries and models.
- Uvicore glues all the pieces together with the Laravel inspired _**Service Provider**_ methodology.
